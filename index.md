# Welcome to the 4<sup>th</sup> edition of the IPOL MLBriefs workshop and hackathon
**<font size="4">May 27<sup>th</sup> — May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2024.</font>**

In many fields of applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, machine learning, image/signal processing, …), new methods and applications are appearing at a vertiginous pace, to the point it is hard to keep up with all new methods.
Yet, being able to understand and try these methods oneself is crucial for research.

To bridge this gap and promote **reproducible research**, during the IPOL MLBriefs workshop and hackathon we will help you use the [IPOL journal and demo system](http://www.ipol.im/)
to **create and publish an online demo of a method** with a companion technical article describing the method and experimentally highlighting its use cases and limitations.

This workshop will be also be a great opportunity to **meet fellow researchers** and attend plenary talks from invited speakers.

**Registration is free but mandatory. Please register by filling [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWX29KpiDAtGN1KnJMXO24JE4ycpcovenixJBcK-RCtWWbrw/viewform?usp=sf_link) by __March 16<sup>th</sup>__.**
