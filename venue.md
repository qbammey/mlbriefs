The ENS is easily accessible from the Paris city centre.

## Coming from Paris
From the Paris city centre, take the RER B towards Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, get off at Le Guichet, then take the bus 9 towards Campus HEC / Gare de Jouy-en-Josas, and get off at Moulon, in front of the ENS.
You can also get off the RER B at Massy-Palaiseau, take bus 91.06 or 91.10, and get off at Moulon.

Count between one hour and one hour and half from Châtelet les Halles to the ENS.

## Coming by train
The ENS is best deserved by the Massy-Palaiseau TGV station, buses 91.06 and 91.10 go from the Massy-Palaiseau bus station (which is next to the train station) to Moulon (in front of the ENS) in 20 to 30 minutes.

If you arrive at any of the other Paris stations, first reach the RER B, then follow the instructions from the [previous section](#coming-from-paris).

## Coming by plane
Paris is served by two major airports: Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly.

The Charles de Gaulle airport is located directly on the RER B, from there you can follow the instructions of the first section ["Coming from Paris"](#coming-from-paris). The trip will take around 2 hours.
Note that in May, the RER B will not operate between Châtelet les Halles and the airport in the evening, starting at 10.45 PM. If you arrive after this hour, you can take the RoissyBus shuttle, which operates between the airport and Paris.

From the Orly airport, take the RER C towards Massy - Palaiseau, stop there and take bus 91.06 or 91.10 to get off at Moulon. The journey will take around one hour.

## Coming by car
There are several free car parks near the ENS, the closest being the "Parking Digiteo". Note that as per university policy, we cannot grant you entry in the ENS car park, which is reserved for employees.
